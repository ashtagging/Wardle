# Wardle - A Wordle clone 

Inspired by the viral game Wordle, this application is a coded clone that utilises a dictionary API and a random word API in order to generate a random word and check that the guessed words are valid words.

The hardest parts to code were the wordGuess function which checks the word against the randomly generated word from the API and displays the tiles colours corresponding to their positions and alters the colours on the keyboard.
